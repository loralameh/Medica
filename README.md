Medical website to help organizing prescriptions and medical records

## What is this project about?
After the Covid-19 pandemic the medical sector has suffered enough thus some gaps were revealed. therefore, we came up with a solution that contribute in the impowering  and enhancement of this sector.  Initially, our website presents a management system for doctors in which they can remotely access and easily keep track of all their patients signs, symptoms and medical record. Our program combines all medical records of the patient in his account organized chronologically as well as his prescriptions as a soft copy for a better implementation of the covid-19 precautions.


## What specific challenges does it overcome?
In this project, the prescription that might have been contaminated with covid-19 is replaced with a soft copy prescription, protecting the people and  the environment simultaneously by reducing the usage of paper. Moreover, the shortage of medicine in Lebanon that people are trying to compensate it from other countries, is made easier by the QR code feature implemented in the website. It enables the prescription reader to quickly check the active components of a medicine to help the pharmacist find an alternative quickly.
